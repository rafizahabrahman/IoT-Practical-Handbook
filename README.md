**IFTTT Update**
Starting early February 2024, IFTTT no longer support webhook for non paid (free) account) so push notifcation tutorial using IFTTT is no longer valid unless you got paid account.
Suggested that you look into events and notification setting using Blynk.Cloud. It is easy to setup, I will try to update the handbook as soon as possible.

**Blynk Update**
The BLYNK_TEMPLATE_ID, BLYNK_TEMPLATE_NAME AND BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN must be placed at the very top of the firmware code (Arduino Sketch) meaning that it must be placed before the line code of Blynk library.
